# Why Use Markdown?
You might be wondering why people use Markdown instead of a WYSIWYG editor. Why write with Markdown when you can press buttons in an interface to format your text? As it turns out, there are several reasons why people use Markdown instead of WYSIWYG editors.

Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.
Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you can import your Markdown files into another Markdown application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a proprietary file format.

# What is a .md file?
A .md file is a plain-text document that contains no other elements. The text can be formatted usingspecial inline text symbols. For example, if you want a word or paragraph to be displayed in bold, you need to type two asterisks before and after it. The “MD” in the .md file extension (also written as .markdown) stands for “Markdown documentation”. Markdown is a lightweight markup language, and each MD file is written in a particular “flavor” of Markdown. It can be helpful to think of the different flavors as being like different dialects of one language.

# Markdown used for?

Some of the many uses of Markdown are readme files, writing messages in online discussion forums, creating rich text using a plain text editor, emails, and technical documentation. Popular sites that use Markdown include GitHub, Trello, Reddit, SourceForge, and StackExchange, among many others.

# Markdown Editors
Markdown is supported by a variety of different systems, from text editors combined with Static Site Generators to dedicated Markdown web applications.
Some editors come built in with basic Markdown capabilities, even if they were not specifically designed for Markdown. Others are designed to extend the Markdown syntax, such as Ghost.
